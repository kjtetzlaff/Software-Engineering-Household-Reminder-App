# Software-Engineering-Household-Reminder-App

It is sometimes easy to forget the little things in life, especially when you are balancing multiple other responsibilities. 
Tasks such as replacing batteries in the smoke detector and replacing the furnace air filter, although very important, tend to just slip through the cracks. 
We wanted to create a simple yet effective way to make sure that these important tasks do not fall through the cracks.

This android app has five main fragments:
1. A start screen with our logo and a button to start
2. A screen allowing you to select common tasks and automatically add reminders for them
3. A screen showing all your tasks - both ovredue tasks to work on and upcoming tasks
4. A screen allowing you to edit which tasks you would like reminders for
5. A screen allowing you to add your own custom tasks for anything that isn't on your list.

Navigation between all screens is complete.
